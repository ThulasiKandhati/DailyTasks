Today i am gona talk about the reusable frameworks that was developed to speed up the data migration.
=> 2 framworks are
1) Data ingestion framework.
2) Data Movement framwrok.

let eme talk about Data ingestion framework.
This framework moves data feed files from on prem to aws s3 and then to snowflake landing area.
in order to use this framework ,
we need to upload the config file with the details in it like s3 bucket name, target table with database and schema, file format, delimiter and another information.
once this config file is ready we can then passs this as a parmeter to client python SDK that then takes care of moving the file.
monitoring id done on cloudwatch with few alarms set like if there is any filure you will get a mail.
This is the fully serverless architecture.if call this sdk and file name and config file as a param.The data will be transformed and loaded in minutes.

services used here are : python SDK as a scripting language ,
                          s3 ,
                          lambda,
                          step function.
                          batch,
                          SNS,
                          SQS.
Data Movement Framework: Now, with data ingestion data is already avialble in snowflake. 
There will a obvious requirment to migrate dat from one database or schema to another. 
then this framework helps you to migrate data from one database to schema with little transformation and can join with another tables to pull data.
This is completely metadata driven. when i say metadata driven. it has set of tables that need to be populated with the highest attribute as job name.
this jobname is used to invoke the data movement from control m .
This is very efficient framework when you have high workloads and less time.


these frameworks helping us to migrate data to SF warehouse sooner.
