=> Types of systems based on general purpose based processes.
1 Single processes systems.
2. Multiproces Processes Systems.
3. Clustered systems.

1. Single processes system:
    a single processes capable of executing general purpose instruction set including instruction from the user processes.
    other special purpose processes also present to perform the device sepecific task. like keyboard. (Keystroke to binary code).
 
2. Multi Processes Systems:
   (Parllel systems or tightly coupled systems).
  Has two or more processes in close communication sharing the computer bus and sometimes the clock, memory and pheripheral devices.
  
  Advantages:
     => increased throughput.
     => economy of scale.
     => Increased reliability.
  Types of multiprocess systems:
     2.1 Symettric multiprocessing
          All the processors are same. and share the worload themselves.
     2.2 Asymmetric multiprocessing
          This is master slave approch. Master assigns tasks.
3. Clustered systems.
      Like multiprocess system,  Clustered system gather together multiple cpu to accomplish the computational work.
      They are composed on 2 or more individual systems coupled together.
      provides high availablity.
      can be structured symmetrically(two or more run application and others monitor) or asymmetrically(one machine hot standby and others run application).
