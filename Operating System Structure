Operating systems vary in thier makeup internally.
Commanlities:
  1) Multiprogramming
  2) Time sharing (Multitasking).

1) Multiprogramming.
    A single user cannot keep the CPU or the I/O device busy all the time.
    Multiprogramming increasses CPU utilization by organizing jobs(code and data) so that CPU has one to execute.
      execute from the job pool.
      effecientley using CPU. when a job is ideal with some I/O operation picks ups another job.
    Conclude: multiprogramming system will use the system resources CPU, memory and pheripheral devices utilized effectively 
    
2) MultiTasking.(TIme Sharing)
   MultiTasking executes multiple jobs by switcjing among them.(users are slower than system).
   Switches occur so frequently that users can intercat with each program while it is running.
   Time sharing requires a interactive (or hands on) computer system.
   which provides direct communication between user and the system.
   Time sharing operating system allows multiple users to share the computer simultaneously.
   switiching between users happens so quickly that they donot realise that the user thinks entire system belongs to him.
      uses CPU scheduling to provide wach user with a small portion of time-shared computer
      Each user has a single separate program loaded into memory.
      A program loaded into memory and executing is called processes.
