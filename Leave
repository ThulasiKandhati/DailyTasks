Hi Kiran, 

My father was suffering from thyphoid.havenot had food for 10 days before he intimated me.i did rapid COVID test for him, the result was negative.

I took good care of him . I felt he is normal and I worked on Friday from my village.

On saturday he felt difficult in breathing. I took for lung CT scan. Report said his lungs are infected. He is high likely infected with COVID.

I admitted him in the hospital for COVID treatment yesterday. He is now on oxygen support.i also have to take care of my leg operated mother and old grand mom.

I was asked leave from the hospital. I will working today.

If there is nay problem I will apply emergence leave.please consider.
